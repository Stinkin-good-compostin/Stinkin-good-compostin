after unzipping both the Stinkin-good-compostin the 
game and the love folder find the love.exe file in the love folder
and drag and drop the Stinkin-good-compostin FOLDER no files the FOLDER
onto the love.exe file and the game will run.

however if you do not see the love.exe file go in the file explorer look toward
the top at view, go to show, and press file extensions.

also dont get it confused with the lovec.exe that file opens the terminal when
you run the game with that so don't do that, not that it affects it just
dont need the terminal.

also there is a game over screen so if for some reason your too good,
purposefully lose to show the game over screen aswell since it is apart of the
game.

if you want no need to message me what you think of it aswell.
